# Bonus Task

Extend your RAG System:

1. **Multi-Source Knowledge Hub**: Combine different data sources (PDFs, websites, CSV files) into a single Vector Store

2. **Source Attribution**: Implement a system that shows the user which document/section the information came from

3. **Metadata Filtering**: Add metadata to your chunks (e.g., date, category) and implement filtered searches

4. **Company Knowledge Base**: Replace the D&D rulebook with your own company documents or a personal knowledge project
