# Bonus Task

Extend your Multi-Tool Assistant:

1. **Tool Chaining**: Create a scenario where the agent must use multiple tools in sequence. Example: "Check the weather in Berlin and save it to my spreadsheet"

2. **Custom HTTP Tool**: Create an HTTP Request Node for a specific API of your choice (e.g., News API, CoinGecko for crypto prices)

3. **Error Handling**: Implement error messages in the system prompt so the agent explains to the user when a tool doesn't work
